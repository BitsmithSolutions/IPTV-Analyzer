	Renamed the iptables kernel module, from "mp2t" to "mpeg2ts".

	 The new name "mpeg2ts" much better acronym/shortname for MPEG2
	 Transport Stream.  The old name "mp2t" came from the Wireshark
	 acronym for this protocol.

	* Version 0.3.2.

	Finally integrated Jan Engelhardts patches to the iptables module,
	back from the Netfilter Workshop, Oct. 2010.  These patches lived
	in the Xtables-addon branch named "mp2t".

	Making a release before:
	 Renaming the kernel module, from "mp2t" to "mpeg2ts".

	* Version 0.3.1.

	This version uses/integrates the compat_xtables kernel module from
	the Xtables-addons project.  This should (hopefully) make the
	iptables module compatible with more kernel versions.  In theory
	the kernel module should be compatible with kernel versions from
	2.6.27 to 2.6.36 (although this is untested).

	* Version 0.3.0-devel.

	This version change is only a developers release.  I just want to
	make sure that the SVN and GIT version uses a different version,
	to avoid confusion.

	* Converting from SVN to GIT

	The project is being prepared for going public.  The internal SVN
	code is converted to a GIT repository, for making it easier to
	cooperate with external developers.

	An SVN tag has been created at revision 2303, to mark the point
	where no further changes should go into SVN.

2010-10-15  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.2.1-devel.

	  Update the iptables module to be compatible with kernel 2.6.35.
	  Send the iptables code for review during Netfilter Workshop 2010.

2009-10-15  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.2.0-devel.

	  Significant changes to the proc file output.  Now everything in
	  the proc file consists of "key:value" pairs separated with
	  spaces.

	* SVN:[1555] Version 0.1.6.

	  This version correspond to the version currently (14/10-2009)
	  running in production on tvprobe002a and tvprobe003a.cxnet.dk.
