Stuff I/we need to change before a release

== iptables-module ==

Add README file, for desc stuff about that the kernel module does not
require recompiling of you kernel.  But it does require the kernel
source as its uses the kernel makefile system.  It also need the
correct symbol table to hook into iptables.

Also describe the interaction with iptables userspace part, where we
simply generate a dyn-loadable module iptables will use.

Implement 'make install'

Rename module from 'xt_mp2t' to 'xt_mpeg2ts'


== Database ==

FIXME: The database layout is completly missing!
Without that, the collector is none functional!


== Collector ==

The ComX internal name were 'tvprobe', we have desited to change the
name to 'iptv-analyzer'.

We need to rename a lot of stuff. e.g. the module include path, the
config file name, etc.

== License ==

Add GNU license files.
