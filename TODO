= Before release =

Stuff I/we need to change before a release

 * collector: Integrate Makefile.PL with configure

 * collector: Integrate version from configure

 * tarball release script


== iptables-module ==

Implement byte and packet counters, for no-signal detection.


Add README file, for desc stuff about that the kernel module does not
require recompiling of you kernel.  But it does require the kernel
source as its uses the kernel makefile system.  It also need the
correct symbol table (Module.symvers) to hook into iptables.

Also describe the interaction with iptables userspace part, where we
simply generate a dyn-loadable module iptables will use.


== Database ==

Document the tables, right now there is only the notes I made during
the evolution of the code.


== Collector ==

Implement no-signal detection.

== Homepage ==

The project needs a homepage.  I prefer a wikipage to start with.
