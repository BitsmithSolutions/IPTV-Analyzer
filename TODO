Stuff I/we need to change before a release


== iptables-module ==

Implement byte and packet counters, for no-signal detection.

Change the module match function, so its possible to just return match
"true" on all mpeg2ts packets, not just the drop detections (which is
actually one TS packet after the actual dropped packet).  This will
serve as a good filter function.

Something like,
  --match-on-drops (default off)
  --disable-drop-detect  /  --detect-drops (default on)
  --disable-counters     /  --enable-counters

Add README file, for desc stuff about that the kernel module does not
require recompiling of you kernel.  But it does require the kernel
source as its uses the kernel makefile system.  It also need the
correct symbol table (Module.symvers) to hook into iptables.

Also describe the interaction with iptables userspace part, where we
simply generate a dyn-loadable module iptables will use.


== Database ==

Document the tables, right now there is only the notes I made during
the evolution of the code.


== Collector ==

Implement no-signal detection, based on the byte and packet counters
from the kernel module.

== Homepage ==

The project needs a homepage.  I prefer a wikipage to start with.
