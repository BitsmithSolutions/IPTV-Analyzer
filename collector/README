The IPTV-collector daemon is part of the IPTV-analyzer project.

The IPTV-collector daemon is written in Perl.  To follow through on
the Perl path, we use a Perl CPAN style MakeMaker setup.

The basic command to produce a makefile is:

 perl Makefile.PL


== DEPENDENCIES ==

The dependencies will hopefully be detected for you when generating
the makefile.

== CONFIG FILES ==

Example config files are available under "etc" directory.
