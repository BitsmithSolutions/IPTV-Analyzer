== From: 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 ===

Need to support packet and byte counters (named "packets" and
"payload_bytes").  The column "packets" already exist, and the column
"bytes" need to be renamed to "payload_bytes".

  ALTER TABLE `log_event`
  	CHANGE `bytes` `payload_bytes` BIGINT(20) unsigned default '0';

Plus a new event type for "no-signal" detection.  As there previously
were only one event type (drops), a side table describing the event
types.

We also need to consider that, potentially/theoretically, is possible
for two events type to occur in the same poll cycle.  Thus, either we
need some kind of bit-vector so several events can be recorded
together, or else the software needs to record two log_event records.
