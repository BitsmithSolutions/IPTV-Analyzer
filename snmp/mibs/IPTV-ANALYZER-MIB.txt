          This trap should be generated when the interface
          state regresses (e.g., goes from Point-to-Point to Down)

          Down) or progresses to a terminal state (e.g.,
          2-Way or Full).  When an neighbor transitions
          from or to Full on non-broadcast multi-access
          and broadcast networks, the trap should be
          generated by the designated router.  A designated
